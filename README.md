# calculator

This repository provides a simple calculator example.

`bigcalc.py` performs addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on
numbers up to fifty digits. The script avoids using the arithmetic symbols
directly in the source code by relying on character codes and the `operator`
module.

Example usage:

```
python bigcalc.py 12345678901234567890 98765432109876543210 +
```
