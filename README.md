# calculator

This repository provides a simple calculator example.

`bigcalc_manual.py` performs addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on
integer strings up to one thousand digits. The script avoids using the
arithmetic symbols directly in the source code by relying on character codes.

Example usage:

```
python bigcalc_manual.py 12345678901234567890 98765432109876543210 +
```
